Python Script to run in Windows Terminal Creates a Kivy of SeedMaker APP for Bitcoin 12/24 Word Seed Phrase Generation. .   

This builds a APP on your PC using Kivy. It was built by GROG3 Beta FREE Demo Version AI on x.com. I was just having a play this is what GROK3 came up with, i had to tell it what to do like 40 different rebiulds to get it right and functioning. It was an adictive and fun way to biuld a program with no knowledge of coding python scriptin langauge.

Instructions to use the Python code>>>

To use it copy the entire code and paste into a regular notepad on Windows PC or Laptop, i haven't tried Apple Mac or Linux but it should work and save the notepad file as SeedMaker.py make sure it is note saved with .txt extension it should be file_name.py so it opens with python. Trick:  If you double click on the file SeedMaker.py it auto opens the APP and it will be instantly usable on screen to have play with.  

You need to have Python installed on you computer and i think Kivy as well. Sorry i am not fully confident with all this as i just followed the directions of GROK to do it all. Search how to make a Kivy app using a Python code file in Google or GROK or another AI and it will talk you through the step even if you don't know how it's amazing and easy if i could do it never done it before and in 48hrs this whole program was built.
